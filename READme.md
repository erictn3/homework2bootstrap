Basic portfolio: i have three pages
1) index- this page is about me 
2) portfolio- this page displays my upcoming projects for the bootcamp
   1) in this page we tried to create a few examples of things i liked for each card using bootstrap grid
3) contact- this page asks for a name email and message in order to contact me specifically

Purpose
1) made a responsive porfolio that adjusts contents within page when minimizing and maximizing page
   1) setbacks: was unable to fully utilize responsiveness towards mobile devices within container
